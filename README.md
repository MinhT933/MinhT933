# 👋 Hi, I’m MinhT933

### Backend Engineer · Golang · Nestjs/Nodejs · System-Oriented

I’m a backend-oriented software engineer focusing on building **reliable services, clean APIs, and scalable systems**.

> Frontend delivers features.  
> Backend keeps the system alive.

---

## 🧠 Tech Focus

- **Primary language:** Golang  
- **Backend:** REST, GraphQL, JWT, concurrency (goroutines)  
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture, service-oriented design, BFF  
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Nginx, GitHub Actions, Cloudflare, Linux (Ubuntu VPS)  
- **Security:** rate limiting, token lifecycle, server hardening (UFW, Fail2ban)

---

## 🧩 Engineering Principles

- Readable code > clever code  
- Explicit is better than implicit  
- APIs should be predictable and boring  
- Design for failure, not just happy paths  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Profile (code-style)

```go
package profile

type BackendEngineer struct {
	Name     string
	Role     string
	Language string
	Focus    []string
}

func Me() BackendEngineer {
	return BackendEngineer{
		Name:     "Phạm Mạnh Toàn",
		Role:     "Backend Engineer",
		Language: "Golang",
		Focus: []string{
			"API design & correctness",
			"Backend architecture",
			"Concurrency & performance",
			"Production infrastructure",
		},
	}
}
```

🚀 Current Focus

Designing backend services with Golang

Improving API performance & reliability

Learning deeper system design & distributed concepts

Building real infrastructure (not toy demos)

🎯 Long-term Goal

Become a strong Backend / System Engineer
who understands how data flows, how systems fail,
and how to design for scale and safety.
